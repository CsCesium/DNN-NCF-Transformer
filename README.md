Certainly! Below is a simple template for a README file that describes how to use a deployed model through a REST API.

# Model API Usage Guide

Welcome to our model API! This guide provides instructions on how to interact with our deployed machine learning model to obtain predictions and recommendations. 

## Overview

Our model is hosted as a RESTful service and can be accessed via standard HTTP methods. Currently, the following endpoints are available:

- `/predict`: Obtain predictions based on input features.
- `/recommend`: Get top-n item recommendations for a user.

## Requirements

To use the API, you'll need an HTTP client to make requests. This could be a tool like `curl` on the command line, libraries like `requests` in Python, or any other HTTP client capable of making POST requests with JSON data.

## Deployment

To deploy the API, just unzip the data.zip to data folder, and run app.py

And run

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Endpoints

### Predict Endpoint

To obtain a prediction, send a POST request with the appropriate JSON payload to the `/predict` endpoint.

**URL**: `http://5000/predict`

**Method**: `POST`

**Payload Example**:


{
    "feature1": "value1",
    "feature2": "value2",
    // ... other required features
}


**Response Example**:


{
    "prediction": "predicted_value"
}


### Recommend Endpoint

To receive item recommendations, send a POST request with user details to the `/recommend` endpoint.

**URL**: `http://5000/recommend`

**Method**: `POST`

**Payload Example**:


{
    "user_id": 123,
    // ... other user details if needed
}


**Response Example**:


{
    "recommendation": ["item1", "item2", "item3", ...]
}


## Usage

Here's an example of how to use `curl` to interact with the predict endpoint:


curl -X POST http://5000/predict \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"feature1": "value1", "feature2": "value2"}'


## Error Handling

If there's an issue with the request, the API will return an error message with an appropriate HTTP status code. For example:

- `400 Bad Request`: Check if the JSON payload is correctly formatted and includes all required fields.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server. Please try again later or contact support.
